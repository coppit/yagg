Version 1.20:
- Over 30X faster. Added an allocations cache for rule lists
- Changed the name to "yagg" and moved development to SourceForge

Version 1.11:
- Added support for empty productions
- Fixed chmod to do the right thing on remote machines
- Fixed a bug where a remote command would be executed even if "cd" failed
- Fixed a missing unindent and a typo for SHORT_RULE_TRACE debug output
- Enhanced debugging information for length computations.

Version 1.10:
- Updated all the examples, tutorial, and documentation
- Polished off everything for public distribution

Version 1.02:
- Switch from File::Find to rsync, which is *much* faster
- This version works completely for the logical expressions and fault trees
  examples.
  - Added a tutorial
  - Changed the terminals input file into a lex-like format
  - Nonterminal input file is now basically yacc+undo actions.
- Added -c flag to rsync to avoid copying identical files, which prevents
  recompilation unless it is needed. Also added --delete to remove previously
  generated files.
- Fixed some bugs in generator_generator when input files don't have head or
  tail blocks
- Moved example input files into separate directories in new examples/
  directory
- Added support for constant strings like "x" 'x' 23 to the nonterminal .yg
  file.
- Added #line directives in the generated code
- Added string length optimization for disabling infeasible productions
- Added test cases.
- Prepared everything for installation and distribution
- Wrote a tutorial and finished the documentation
- Added -L and -C flags
- Restructured the file layout

Version 1.01:
- Added TODO file
- Restructured parsing of the grammars. Grammar now returns info on the union,
  and parses the union name declarations. (See the comments for the Post_Parse
  function)
- Moved template files into the input_generator_code directory, renaming them
  to foo.template.cc, foo.template.h, etc.
- Added code to remove any rule lists containing the special "error" token
- Changed syntax for 'atomic_#' to ['atomic_#']
- Updated the grammar to bless rules as 'SIMPLE' or 'ALTERNATION'. Renamed
  'GENERATOR' to 'GENERATOR_EQUIVALENCE' and 'EQUIVALENCE' to
  'ALTERNATION_EQUIVALENCE'.
- Implemented action code blocks, with a few rough parts. See TODO file
- Fixed terminal generation for alternation
- Updated the generator with the changes from generate-dfts-oo
  (yacc_compatible branch). This makes it easier to generate the code blocks.
  I can see that the terminal generation isn't quite right... Need to fix
  that.
- Renamed template files.

Version 1.0:
- Initial version
